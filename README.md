# Technical-Code
Documenting design patterns and code techniques that i've been learning and implementing them in a practical way. This is a Playground project that can be easily navigated as a book, so I highly recommend activating **"Rendered Markup"** mode. To activate go to: **Editor**, then click **Show Rendered Markup**.

Heres a list of implementations i've done so far:

1. Linked List
2. Builder Design Pattern
