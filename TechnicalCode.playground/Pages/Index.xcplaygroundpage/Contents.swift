 # Technical Codes
 This book is intended to document and save technical coding that I have done for learning, like design patterns and code techniques. Feel free to copy or improve any code.
 
 - Note:
    If you are reading this from Xcode I highly recommend you to activate "Rendered Markup". To activate go to: **Editor**, then click **Show Rendered Markup**.
